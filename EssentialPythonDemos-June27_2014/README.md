Essential Python Demos
===========

Hi, I'm Michael Kennedy. Welcome to my demos repository for my 
[Essential Python Training Course](http://www.develop.com/training-course/essential-python-with-pyramid-sqlalchemy-nosql-and-core-language-features) 
from DevelopMentor. 

If you are in one of my courses *right now*, just click 'Download ZIP' or clone this repo to your system. On the other hand, if you took my course awhile ago and want access to the demos, your course has probably been moved to another branch. Use the branches dropdown to find it just contact me (email address is listed in my github profile).

If you are **not** in one of our courses, please consider DevelopMentor for your [Python Training](http://www.develop.com/training-courses/python)!

Cheers
