    "ShortName": "EF4 - Entity Framework 6.0 with Data Services Training",
    "CourseDetails": "\r\n<b>Overview</b>\r\n<em>\r\n<br><br>\r\nWith Visual Studio 2008 Microsoft released LINQ (Language Integrated Query), a\r\npowerful API and set of language extensions for querying and manipulating data,\r\nwhether it resides in a database, an XML document or an in-memory collection.\r\nWith .NET 4.0 and Visual Studio 2010 Microsoft is releasing a new version of the\r\nEntity Framework, an industrial-strength object-relational mapping technology\r\nthat allows you to build a conceptual object model over any backend database -\r\nnot just SQL Server.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis course will teach you to exploit the full capabilities of Microsoft's\r\nrevolutionary new platform for universal data access. You will learn to build\r\nreal-world n-tier applications using test-driven methodologies and robust\r\narchitectural design patterns.  You will also learn to employ ADO.NET Data\r\nServices in order to integrate data from the Internet cloud.\r\n</em>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Day 1</b><br><br>\r\n<b>Introduction to Functional Programming in C#</b><br>\r\nThe C# Programming Language has evolved to include concepts borrowed from the\r\nworld of functional programming.  This session will start with a look at\r\nIterators and Anonymous Methods, which were introduced in C# 2.0 and lay the\r\ngroundwork for adding functional capabilities to your code.  You'll also learn\r\nnew features that make functional programming a first class citizen of C# 3.0:\r\nanonymous types, extension methods and lambda expressions.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>LINQ to Objects</b><br>\r\nThe central feature of .NET 3.5 is Language Integrated Query (LINQ), making\r\nquery a first-class feature of the programming language. Now we can group, sort,\r\nand filter in-memory collections of objects. With SQL-like syntax (from, where,\r\nselect, orderby, group by), we can leverage an assortment of query operators to\r\nperform join, partition, conversion, and aggregation functions.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>LINQ to XML</b><br>\r\nLINQ to XML provides an easy-to-use API for both reading and writing XML 05_files.\r\nIt's the successor to DOM and XPath for navigating and searching XML documents.\r\nLINQ to XML offers an approach to XML queries that is element-centric and makes\r\nmanaging namespaces more straightforward. At the same time, it provides a way to\r\nperform serialization of objects to XML, while supplying a bridge to legacy\r\nAPI's, such as XPath and XSLT.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Day 2</b><br><br>\r\n<b>LINQ to SQL</b><br>\r\nFor years a problem known as the \"object relational impedance mismatch\" has\r\nstood as a barrier between the worlds of objects and relational data. In the\r\npast developers were responsible for writing most of the plumbing code required\r\nto go from one to the other. You'll learn to write LINQ to SQL queries that\r\ntransparently generate SQL statements to return CLR objects. Furthermore, LINQ\r\nto SQL tracks changes to your objects and persists those changes to the database\r\nwhen requested.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Entity Framework: Architecture</b><br>\r\nWhile LINQ to SQL is restricted for use with SQL Server 2000 or later, the\r\nEntity Framework can be used with other relational databases, and it includes a\r\npowerful mapping engine to help insulate your application from changes to the\r\ndatabase schema.  We will examine how to write queries that use LINQ to return\r\nobjects or use Entity SQL to execute a data reader.  We'll also survey many new\r\nfeatures available in version 4.0 of the Entity Framework, such as support for\r\nPOCO's (Plain Old CLR Objects), customizable code-generation templates, lazy\r\nloading, and real-time change-tracking.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Entity Framework: LINQ to Entities</b><br>\r\nLINQ to Entities combines the flexibility of the Entity Framework with the power\r\nof language-integrated query, providing compile-time type-safety and\r\nsyntax-checking.  You'll learn how to improve performance by using compiled\r\nqueries and views.  We will also cover additional functions and operators for\r\nLINQ queries available with EF 4.0, including the ability to execute queries and\r\ncommands directly against the database.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Day 3</b><br><br>\r\n<b>Entity Framework: Real-World Topics</b><br>\r\nIn this session we'll focus on how to make EF applications production-ready.\r\nWe'll discuss managing database connections and how to use transactions\r\neffectively, including setting the isolation level and when to use local versus\r\ndistributed transactions.  You'll learn how to control concurrency and resolve\r\nconflicts among multiple users.  We'll also cover improved support for stored\r\nprocedures in EF 4.0 and when to use stored procedures versus dynamic queries.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Entity Framework: N-Tier Applications</b><br>\r\nEntity Framework 4.0 ships with a code-generation template for \"self-tracking\r\nentities.\"  These are POCO classes that are ignorant of persistence concerns but\r\nwhich know how to track their own change state.  You'll learn how to use STE's\r\nin an n-tier application, building a Data Access Layer to abstract away database\r\noperations from the rest of your application.  We'll also discuss best practices\r\nfor transactions and concurrency management in service-oriented applications.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Entity Framework: Mapping Scenarios</b><br>\r\nThe Entity Framework provides a great deal of flexibility for mapping entities\r\nto database tables.  Here you'll learn how to customize the EF mapping 05_files to\r\nsplit a table row into different entities and select alternatives for object\r\ninheritance in the database, including table-per-hierarchy, table-per-type and\r\ntable-per-concrete-type.  You'll also learn how to take advantage of\r\nimprovements in the EDM design tools that ship with Visual Studio 2010.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Day 4</b><br><br>\r\n<b>Entity Framework: Development Approaches (Patterns, TDD, Model-First)</b><br>\r\nApplication maintainability needs to be part of the design process from the\r\nbeginning, which is why it pays to consider common design patterns for\r\ndata-centric applications.  We will examine how to use various design patterns,\r\nsuch as Repository and Unit of Work, and examine techniques for employing a test\r\ndriven development (TDD) methodology.  We will also explore a \"model-first\"\r\napproach to developing EF applications, which allows you to create an entity\r\ndata model from scratch then create tables based on the model.  The process is\r\nfully customizable and extensible, for example allowing you to execute different\r\nstrategies for representing inheritance relations in the database.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>ADO.NET Data Services</b><br>\r\nADO.NET Data Services combines patterns and libraries that enable any data store\r\nto be exposed as a flexible data service. These data services integrate\r\nnaturally with the Web and can be consumed by Web clients within a corporate\r\nnetwork or across the Internet. In this module you'll learn to expose data to\r\nweb clients as a REST-ful resource, addressable with URIs that clients can\r\ninteract with using standard HTTP verbs, such as GET and POST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Appendices</b><br><br>\r\n<b>LINQ to SQL: Advanced Topics</b><br>\r\nContrary to popular belief, LINQ to SQL is designed for real-world applications\r\nthat run in a production environment. For example, LINQ to SQL allows you to use\r\nstored procedures for improved performance and security, and it supports the\r\ndetection and resolution of conflicts among multiple users.  You'll master these\r\nand other advanced topics, such as eager loading, object caching, identity\r\nmanagement and change tracking.  In addition, you'll learn effective transaction\r\nmanagement and how to write partial methods for data validation.\r\n<br><br> \r\n<b>Custom LINQ Providers</b><br>\r\nLINQ can be used to query almost any conceivable data source. All that's needed\r\nis a way to translate a query expression into some other form, such as SQL\r\nstatements or even web service operations.  Here you'll learn here how to map\r\nLINQ expression trees to data source specific queries in order to add a LINQ\r\nfacade to just any API.\r\n",
